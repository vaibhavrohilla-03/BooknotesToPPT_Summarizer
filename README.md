#  Book Summarizer using NLP and TF-IDF

This project is my first attempt at learning Machine Learning — built in under 2 weeks. It summarizes PDF textbooks using NLP techniques and TF-IDF, and even generates PowerPoint slides for the extracted topics
Not that good tho I would say but good enough.

##  Features

- Extracts and preprocesses text from PDF files
- Detects topics using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Generates summarized bullet points
- Automatically creates PowerPoint slides
- Simple web interface using Flask

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Flask** – Web application framework
- **PyPDF2** & **PyMuPDF (fitz)** – PDF text extraction
- **Scikit-learn** – TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- **NLTK** – Tokenization, stopwords, frequency distribution
- **python-pptx** – PowerPoint slide generation
- **NumPy** – Data handling and manipulation
